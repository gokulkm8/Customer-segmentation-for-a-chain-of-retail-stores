# Problem Statement :

* A chain of retail stores wants to launch a marketing campaign. Because of limited resources, they cannot target individual customers. This means that  there is a need to optimize the targeting criteria so as to spend more on customers that will generate more revenue for the store
* Analyze the sales datas and arrive at actionable insights for growing the business

# Analysis Plan : 

* Exploratory Data Analysis

* RFM analysis for customer segmentation

# Insights :
* As per the data between 2010-2011, the retail store sold more than 3600 distinct products to 4300+ customers across 37 different countries
* The unit price of top 5 revenue contributing products are less than or equal to the average unit price considering all the products in the retail store. This is obvious because lesser the price, more will be the sales of the product
* 1700 products accounts for 80% of the sales 
* 90% of sales are from UK followed by Germany and France at 2% each
* 80% of sales are happening between 10 am to 3pm
* 50% of sales are happening between September to December nearing the Christmas & New Year
* % of customers ‘lost’ are almost nil which is a good sign for the business showing excellent customer retention
* More than 50% of the customers are ‘Potential loyalists’ , ‘Customers needing attention’ and ‘Loyal customers’
* 13% of the customers are the ‘Champions’ whos spends the most and has high recency and frequency score
* At the same time there are 12% customers who are at risk of moving into danger zone with below average spendings, frequency and recency score who needs attention

# Recommendations :

* Although there are sales in 37 different countries, 90% accounts to UK and Germany and France are at 2% each. This is a huge difference and so there is a need to do an in depth analysis country wise to promote the sales in different countries apart from UK. Since the sales are high in UK, the marketing campaigns should be focused on other countries including Germany & France
* 1700 out of 4300+ products accounts for 80% of the sales. Some of the low selling products can be stopped which will reduce the inventory requirements while maintaining the revenue at similar levels
* Large number of stocks to be maintained during the year end between September to December which are the months of peak sales in a year
* Advantages can be given to ‘Champion’ customers on new product releases or flash sales with early intimations and reminders, initial booking advantages for new product releases
* Credit card facilities can be given to ‘champions’ and ‘loyal customers’ at reduced interest rates as a reward for high RFM scores and also to increase customer retention
* Those customers at risk of losing ( who used to be frequent buyers but the recency score is very low ) can be reconnected with personalized emails, discount vouchers on products they used to buy earlier
* Those coming under the ‘lost’ segment with low RFM scores can be ignored because the percentage is very low to invest resources and since the monetory value is also low, the value addition with respect to revenue will be very low
